title: Code of Conduct
---

We are dedicated to providing an enjoyable event experience for everyone. As a Community, we value and respect all people, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ability, shape, size or preferred mode of transportation. We will not tolerate vilification, abuse or harassment in any form.

We appreciate that cultural differences may cause misunderstandings, so we will try to clarify these and smooth misunderstandings as they arise. We expect people to be both polite and proactive, and to make an effort to ensure a pleasant event experience for everyone.

Participants behaving in ways that run counter to these principles risk being denied entrance or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, unauthorized or inappropriate photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including expelling the offender from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event team immediately.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social events. We are committed to a fun and productive event for all attendees, and believe that this policy will help achieve that goal.

We ask for the cooperation of all attendees in achieving this goal. Thank you!
