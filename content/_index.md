Transitous, MOTIS, OpenStreetMap, OpenTripPlanner, and many more!

## Who are we?

We are a group of people working on different transport-related open-source and open-data
projects. With this conference we want to create a space to connect with others working in the
same area, to have time for exchange, learning from each other, starting collaborations.

## Who is this event for?

Anyone who works in public transport, either on your free time or commercially, who is open to open
source and open data.

## What to expect?

This will be an <b>unconference</b>, rather than a traditional conference.

This means less focus on talks and more on exchange and discussion. And we'll have participants play a big
role in deciding which topics/sessions/workshops will feature in the program.
