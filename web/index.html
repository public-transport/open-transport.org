            <p class="text-center max-w-xl text-base">
                We are a group of people working on different transport-related open-source and open-data
                projects. With this conference we want to create a space to connect with others working in the
                same area, to have time for exchange, learning from each other, starting collaborations.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="text-center max-w-xl text-base">
               Anyone who works in public transport, either on your free time or commercially, who is open to open
               source and open data.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 text-center max-w-xl text-base">
                We are still working out the details of the conference program. But we do already know that we
                want this to be an <b>unconference</b>, rather than a traditional conference.

            <p class="mb-2 text-center max-w-xl text-base">
                This means less focus on talks and more on exchange and discussion. And we'll have participants play a big
                roll in deciding which topics/sessions/workshops will feature in the program. There will likely be sessions for
                lightning talks and maybe one or two standard talks, as well.

                Do you already have an idea of a topic or session that you think should be featured?
